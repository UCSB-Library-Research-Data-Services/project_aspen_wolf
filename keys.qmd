## Key Principles to Explain (The "Why")

When you show this tree, highlight these four logic checks:

1. The .Rproj Root Anchor

    The Problem: The original script had setwd("C:/Users/Alex/...").

    The Fix: By adding a .Rproj file, R automatically sets the working directory to the project root. Now, the code read.csv("01_data/processed/data.csv") works on everyone's computer immediately.

2. Numbered Scripts (01_, 02_)

    The Problem: The original folder had analysis.R and script_working.R. You didn't know which to run first.

    The Fix: Numbering forces a sequence. You know 01 must happen before 02.

3. The "Raw" vs. "Processed" Airlock

    The Problem: The original folder had data.csv and data_clean.csv mixed together.

    The Fix: Raw data is read-only. If you corrupt your raw data, the project is dead. By physically separating them, you prevent accidental overwrites.

4. The "Outputs" Sandbox

    The Problem: Figures and tables were mixed with raw data.

    The Fix: The 03_outputs folder is treated as disposable. You should be able to delete this entire folder and regenerate it perfectly by running your scripts.
